    "Ans=A t-test and a z-test are both statistical hypothesis tests used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups or to assess a sample mean in relation to a population mean.

    "Use Case: T-tests are primarily used when you have a small sample size (typically less than 30) and when you do not know the population standard deviation. They are appropriate for testing hypotheses about the means of samples from populations with unknown or different variances.\n",
    "Example Scenario: Suppose you want to test whether there is a significant difference in the average test scores of two different groups of students, Group A and Group B, where the sample size for each group is less than 30. In this case, you would use a t-test to compare the means of the two groups.\n",

You have a large sample of cereal boxes (more than 30) and you have historical data for the population standard deviation of box weights.
